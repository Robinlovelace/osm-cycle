## Abstract



## Introduction



The aims of the project are as follows:

1. Describe the cycle path data in Open Street Map and test the hypothesis that it is a good source of data on cycle paths in Great Britain, suitable for academic research.
2. Compare the OSM cycle path data with a proprietary dataset.
3. Describe and explain the spatio-temporal distribution of additions to the the cycle path dataset and investigate how this corresponds with investment in cycle schemes overall.
4. Use the results to discuss the use of crowd-sourced data in mission-critical
professional planning applications.


## Datasets

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# nrow(cways)
# nrow(bicycle_most)
# nrow(ncn)
```


### Open Street Map data

The cycle paths were extracted from the up-to-date and
compressed 'british-isles' .osm.pbf
file (746 Mb),
downloaded from OSM services provider
[Geofabrik.de](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/british-isles.html). This was converted for processing into a raw .osm
(14.7 Gb) text
file, a variant of the xml filetype, using the command-line program *osmconvert*,
accessed through the Linux command line.

To take only navigable paths, the first stage was to subset all *ways*.
This led to a 4.9 Gb file containing 3.35 million features. Of course,
only a small sample of this large dataset is related to cycling (Fig. x).
A careful sampling strategy was therefore used to ensure all bicycle paths,
according to OSM data, were captured and whilst minimising
data that do not represent bicycle paths. As shown in Fig. x,
the majority of the route network in OSM is *potentially* cyclable,
with most residential, service and unclassified highways being suitable
for bicycles. However, we are not interested in where one *can* cycle
in this dataset: the focus is on where local authorities and other organisations
have invested in sustainable transport by constructing bicycle paths.
The 'cycleway' tag is the 11th most commonly used tag, comprising 1.6%
of all highway tags in Great Britain. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# summary(hways$highway)
# top10 <- rev(tail(sort(summary(hways$highway)), 15))
# labs <- factor(names(top10), levels = rev(names(top10)) )
# # top10 <- sort(summary(hways$highway), decreasing = T)[1:10]
# # sort(summary(hways$highway))[ length(top10) - 10: length]
# ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = labs, y = top10 / 1000, fill = labs), stat = "identity") +
#   coord_flip() +
#   scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
#   scale_fill_manual(values = c(rep("grey", 4), "black", rep("grey", 10)), guide = F) +
#   xlab("OSM highway type") +
#   ylab("Number of line features (1000s)") +
#   theme_classic()   
# ggsave("figures/osm-highway-types.png", width = 9, height = 5)
```

Tagged cycleways comprise only a small proportion of all cycle paths OSM,
which are defined using a wide variety of both tags and relations.
This means that extracting all cycle paths cannot be acheived
with a simple one-line operation. The following command, using the command-line
Java program `osmfilter`, for example, will extract only a sample of the
total length of cycle paths stored in Open Street Map:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
osmfilter data.osm --keep="highway=cycleway" >bcways.osm
```

This is because the 'cycleway' attribute
is only one of the possible *tags* used to represent cycle paths.
There are many additional tags from a variety of variables that can
but used to identify cycle paths, each with subtly different
(and sometimes overlapping)
meanings (Table x).

## Methods and results



## Discussion

## Conclusion

This is the first study to our knowledge which decisively finds a free and
crowd-sourced dataset to be more appropriate to a critical application than
a professionally produced proprietary dataset from a national cartographic
organisation. In this case, Open Street Map was found to provide more coverage,
attributes, continuity and recency than the commercial dataset provided by
the UK's national geospatial data provider Ordnance Survey.

How OSM data is better - para.

To be fair to OSM para... - include areas where OS data excels.

The consequences of this finding...
