Analysis of osm cycle path data

### Load Nottingham cycle data

Some example osm bicycle path data has been made available to get 
a handle on what it looks like. 
The bicycle paths were filtered from Postgres database using two 
methods: `bicycle='yes'`, and `highway = 'cycleway'`, to 
demonstrate that there are different ways to define a cycle path in OSM, 
as in the real world. This is how to load these layers into R:

```{r}
library(rgdal)
pBikeYes <- readOGR("data/", "lines-cycle-yes")
pCycleway <- readOGR("data/", "lines-cycleway")
pBikeYes <- spTransform(pBikeYes, CRS("+init=epsg:27700"))
pCycleway <- spTransform(pCycleway, CRS("+init=epsg:27700"))
```

What are the attributes of these lines?
Let's take a look:

```{r}
plot(pBikeYes, col = "blue")
plot(pCycleway, col = "red", add=T)
```

### Calclulate length
Let's look at the respective lengths of each line:

```{r}
library(rgeos)
gLength(pBikeYes)/1000 # length in km
gLength(pCycleway)/1000
```

Clearly, paths marked with the cyclway attribute in the highway variable
are slightly longer. Yet these points do not completely overlap, 
as illustrated in the map:

### Preliminary time series analysis

`osm2pgsql`, used to create the datasets loaded above, does not import timestamp data by default. Therefore, we use a different dataset to illustrate
time series data, this time loaded via the `osmar`R package.
See my [osm-tutorial GitHub page](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/osm-tutorial) 
for more on this.

```{r}
library(osmar)
load("data/bike-paths-lds.RData")
plot(bikePaths)
class(bikePaths$nodes$attrs$timestamp)
tstamp <- as.POSIXct(bikePaths$nodes$attrs$timestamp, format=)
hist(bikePaths$nodes$attrs$timestamp, breaks = "year")
```

### Further work

The above steps are very basic introductions to the osm datasets and how we we
work with them. In this project we will make similar analyses, but 
on a much larger scale. We hope to generate policy relevant findings 
about a) the quality of cycle path data in OSM and b) the spatio-temporal
distribution of paths, using imperfect OSM data as a proxy.
