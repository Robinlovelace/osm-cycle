Analysis of osm cycle path data

### Load Nottingham cycle data

Some example osm bicycle path data has been made available to get 
a handle on what it looks like. 
The bicycle paths were filtered from Postgres database using two 
methods: `bicycle='yes'`, and `highway = 'cycleway'`, to 
demonstrate that there are different ways to define a cycle path in OSM, 
as in the real world. This is how to load these layers into R:


```r
library(rgdal)
```

```
## Loading required package: sp
## rgdal: version: 0.8-10, (SVN revision 478)
## Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
## Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 1.10.0, released 2013/04/24
## Path to GDAL shared files: /usr/share/gdal/1.10
## Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012, [PJ_VERSION: 480]
## Path to PROJ.4 shared files: (autodetected)
```

```r
pBikeYes <- readOGR("data/", "lines-cycle-yes")
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "data/", layer: "lines-cycle-yes"
## with 712 features and 66 fields
## Feature type: wkbLineString with 2 dimensions
```

```r
pCycleway <- readOGR("data/", "lines-cycleway")
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "data/", layer: "lines-cycleway"
## with 969 features and 66 fields
## Feature type: wkbLineString with 2 dimensions
```

```r
pBikeYes <- spTransform(pBikeYes, CRS("+init=epsg:27700"))
pCycleway <- spTransform(pCycleway, CRS("+init=epsg:27700"))
```


What are the attributes of these lines?
Let's take a look:


```r
plot(pBikeYes, col = "blue")
plot(pCycleway, col = "red", add = T)
```

### Calclulate length
Let's look at the respective lengths of each line:


```r
library(rgeos)
```

```
## rgeos version: 0.2-19, (SVN revision 394)
##  GEOS runtime version: 3.3.8-CAPI-1.7.8 
##  Polygon checking: TRUE
```

```r
gLength(pBikeYes)/1000  # length in km
```

```
## [1] 109.1
```

```r
gLength(pCycleway)/1000
```

```
## [1] 150.2
```


Clearly, paths marked with the cyclway attribute in the highway variable
are slightly longer. Yet these points do not completely overlap, 
as illustrated in the map:

### Preliminary time series analysis

`osm2pgsql`, used to create the datasets loaded above, does not import timestamp data by default. Therefore, we use a different dataset to illustrate
time series data, this time loaded via the `osmar`R package.
See my [osm-tutorial GitHub page](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/osm-tutorial) 
for more on this.


```r
library(osmar)
```

```
## Loading required package: XML
## Loading required package: RCurl
## Loading required package: bitops
## Loading required package: gtools
## Loading required package: geosphere
## 
## Attaching package: 'osmar'
## 
## The following object is masked from 'package:utils':
## 
##     find
```

```r
load("data/bike-paths-lds.RData")
plot(bikePaths)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-41.png) 

```r
class(bikePaths$nodes$attrs$timestamp)
```

```
## [1] "POSIXlt" "POSIXt"
```

```r
tstamp <- as.POSIXct(bikePaths$nodes$attrs$timestamp, format = )
hist(bikePaths$nodes$attrs$timestamp, breaks = "year")
```

### Further work

The above steps are very basic introductions to the osm datasets and how we we
work with them. In this project we will make similar analyses, but 
on a much larger scale. We hope to generate policy relevant findings 
about a) the quality of cycle path data in OSM and b) the spatio-temporal
distribution of paths, using imperfect OSM data as a proxy.
