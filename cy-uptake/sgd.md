The shifting geographical distribution of cycling to work in England
========================================================

This paper uses data from the UK Census to
identify the geographical distribution of change in the proportion
of commuters cycling as their primary means of travel to work.
It was found that there is a clear geographical pattern to recent shift,
with cycle commuting falling in most areas but growing in large cities.
It is notable that, outside London, the cycle commuting has declined nationwide.
To try to explain this trend a geographically weighted regression model will be
used. Data on average income, quality and quantity of cycle paths,
road traffic casualties and proxies of investment in cycling and driving
will be tested as explanatory variables.
It is hoped that the findings
will be of use to policy makers looking for an evidence base on which to
allocate future cycling investments.

Keywords: cycling, bicycle commuting, geographic variation.
